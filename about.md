I'm a security architect, who works for a medium sized consultancy. Given my seniority, I don't really do anything deep and technical anymore. Most of my life is spent in meetings, writing presentations and building complicated spreadsheets.

I miss the hands-on techy stuff. So, I thought I'd challenge myself in 2026 to solve problems with code. To help keep me motivated, I've decided to keep a diary of my progress. Here it is!

May 2026 be full of technical curiosity, hands on hackery and problem-solving enjoyment!
