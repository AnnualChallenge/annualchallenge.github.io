# Annual Challenge

# 29 Dec 2025
For my 2026 New Year's resolution,  I've decided to set myself technical challenges and document my progress for anyone to follow. I'm starting a bit early, just to get everything set up.

A bit about me: I'm a security architect and I spend most of my working day doing stuff that can't really be considered as hands-on anymore. A typical working week consists of many meeting, lots of emails, writing documents, creating architecture diagrams, supporting business development, and (when I do have some spare time) trying to develop security-architecture strategy. As a result I'm really hankering for that technical, hands-on past.

So, for 2026, I'm planning to set myself and document technical challenges to solve real-life problems (problems for me at least).

My first challenge: **setting up a single-page blog and repo to record my fun (and progress too)**.

To keep costs low - I've done the following:
- I've registered a cheap 'dot com' vanity domain for this project.
- I've set up a Github repo to store code, config and any documentation I may produce.
- I've configured Github pages to host this Blog, as it is free and uses Markdown (so I don't need to spent time writing HTML / Javascript / CSS, or dealing with a CMS, like Wordpress).

The look and feel of Github pages is a bit shoddy. I think I'll next spend a bit of time working on the styling of it; after which, I will  look into methods to simplify the publishing process - 'git' would be the simplest approach, but for the 'fun' bit I thinking of coding something rudimentary in Python to do the publishing bit.
